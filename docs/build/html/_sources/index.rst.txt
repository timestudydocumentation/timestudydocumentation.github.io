The **Temporal Influences on Movement and Exercise (TIME) Study** uses mobile and wearable technologies to measure moment-to-moment experiences that shape our health behaviors and decision making. The goal is to study how different contextual and situational factors explain the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. We are using a combination of phone-based experience sampling, wearable-based micro-EMA, and passive sensing to build predictive models of health behavior at the individual and group levels. We conducted a within-subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period among ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-29).
